Known issues

- One or two buildings don't spawn loot (awaiting DayZ Editor fix)
- Various object placements issues 

Next update will focus on overhauling dynamic events, and adding new ones from 1.28. There are also object fixes and additions to be made, but DayZ Editor isn't working so will wait for dev to fix.
